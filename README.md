# Books

This started when I was trying to find an epub version of the book "The book of shaders". 
https://thebookofshaders.com/

This repo contains an epub and a pdf version of the content for reading in devices like Kindle Paperwhite

There is a process to convert it to a printable version, but many people said it didn't work right. 

What I did to create the epub,
1. I found someone else that made a PDF version of the content.
2. Downloaded Calibre which has book format conversion functionality: https://calibre-ebook.com/
3. Added a cover image for it and added author information
4. Convert the PDF to an Epub with calibre

Not sure if anyone else will find this useful, but it would have saved me a little bit of time.
